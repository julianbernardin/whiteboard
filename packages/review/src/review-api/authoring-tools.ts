      'Create a review of saved working files, immutable commits or a GitHub PR. Revisions are resolved on acceptance. A worktree target reviews the saved files in its checkout, uncommitted ones included and untracked ones left out (git add -N a new file to include it), against base: the branch to compare against, by default the default branch of the repository. The diff starts at the merge base of base and HEAD, which follows rebases. Omitted commits base means source at head with no diff; supply the parent to review introduced changes. For a GitHub PR, pullRequestUrl alone is enough: target and title become optional, and the host fetches the PR into a registered checkout of its repository and pins the current PR head and GitHub diff base, titled from the PR. When a review for that PR exists, it is returned instead, reporting whether its head moved and whether an agent is working on it; update it in place, move its target with review_set_target, or create a separate review with reuseExisting. kind:"scratchpad" names the one scratchpad, which the host creates itself. kind:"project" without title ensures the fixed default Project; with a nonblank title it creates an additional Project with a UUID and optional project.links. Projects do not take review targets or PR fields. The result carries review, the review as review_list shows it: its target with resolved commits, origin (its PR), repositoryName and repositoryPath, so no follow-up read is needed before diffing. When Desktop is available the review opens there and the result reports opened, softwareMapEnabled and environmentIssues, as review_open does; set open:false to author in the background without taking over Desktop.',
